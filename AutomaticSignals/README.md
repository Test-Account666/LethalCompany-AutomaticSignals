# Automatic Signals Mod

This mod allows solo players to use the signal translator.<br>

If you buy a signal translator, it will turn into a helpful automatic tool!<br>

What can it do?<br>

- Detect and warn you about enemies<br>
- Teleport you, if you spin or shake your camera<br>
- Open blast doors for you<br>
- Deactivate turrets that suppose a threat<br>

Don't worry. These features are somewhat balanced.<br>
- Detected enemies may show up as "Enemy" or "Red Dot" instead of a proper name<br>
- The teleport has a chance of just teleporting you to a random place inside the facility<br>
- Blast doors also may close<br>
- Deactivating may fail, resulting in you being filled with lead<br>
<br>
- All actions have big cool downs<br>
